/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * Use this file to specify configuration settings for use while developing
 * the app on your personal system: for example, this would be a good place
 * to store database or email passwords that apply only to you, and shouldn't
 * be shared with others in your organization.
 *
 * These settings take precedence over all other files in `config/`, including
 * those in the env/ subfolder.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *    By default, `config/local.js` is included in your .gitignore, so if you're
 *    using git as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *    this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *    Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *    machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *    (like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *    of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
 *    In a production environment, you'll probably want to leave this file out
 *    entirely and configure all of your production overrides using `env/production.js`,
 *    or environment variables, or a combination of both.
 *
 *
 * For more information, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.com/docs/concepts/configuration/the-local-js-file
 *
 * For a reference of misc. top-level settings not covered by other config files, see:
 * http://sailsjs.com/docs/reference/configuration/sails-config
